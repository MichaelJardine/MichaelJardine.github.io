This is the homepage for Digital Natural Sciences UK (DNS UK). DNS UK is the UK node of the DiSSCo (Distributed System of Scientific Collections) research infastructure which aims to unite and digtise Europe's natural hisotry collections. 

Currently based at the Natural History Museum (NHM) in London and funded by an AHRC scoping grant, we are working to create a network of natural history collections and asses both their digital readyness for digitilisation and the training needs they require to perform digitilisation for theier collections. 

This site is being developed to host training resources including background information for digitilisation prepardness and specific workflows for specimen digitilisation.
