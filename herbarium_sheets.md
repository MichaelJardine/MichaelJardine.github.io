# Herbarium Sheets

Plant specimens are typically preserved on paper known as herbarium sheets. Plant specimens have been commonly collected for hundreds of years and form a significant part of UK natural history collections. 

Although the size of these sheets can vary, they are typically standardised wihtin collections meaning they can be efficiently digitised using standard photogrpahy sets ups.

Here we describe and demonstrate a workflow to digitise herbarium sheets that has been succesful at the NHM in London.
